/*
    Problem description : Write one constructor that accepts as parameters the name of the citizen and the language he or she is speaking:
The language is specified as an enum type with the values ENGLISH, GERMAN and DUTCH (see the lecture
slides, chapter 2, Data: Variables, Types, Constants). Ensure that you fill the array of characters for name and
check for the length of the provided name. Additionally, define a default constructor, which initializes the member
variables name with Anonymous, age with 0 and language with DUTCH. Depending on the value of the
language member variable, the member function sayHello can display the following output:
Language output of the function sayHello
GERMAN Hallo
ENGLISH Hi there
DUTCH Goeiedag
Write a main program (mainCitizen.cpp) that creates two objects of class Citizen by using the implemented
constructors and test your implemented sayHello member function for each object. The name of the citizen
does not need to be asked from the command line, it should be directly passed as a parameter in the constructor.
